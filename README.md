# DSA-I-project

Demonstrates how Heaps data structure is implemented using **Linked Lists**. 

(minHeap is used and the list example shown below had been integrated into the code)

Use appropriate coding to implement the correct methods to perform:
* Inserting a new element in the heap (performing the necessary steps to maintain the heap properties).
* Deleting an element from the heap (performing the necessary steps to maintain the heap properties).* deletion of existing elements

P.S The program is written in C++ in order to satiate project requirements.
